Loan Officer (Retail) Experience 
Purpose 
The Loan Officer (Retail) module will provide a fully mobile, end-to-end workspace that 
enables Loan Officers to manage their borrower pipeline, process applications, and move 
loans from pre-approval to closing — all from the palm of their hand. This feature set 
eliminates the need to depend on slow or disconnected desktop systems when working 
remotely, ensuring a seamless, real-time experience even in low-bandwidth environments. 
Core Functional Requirements 
Pipeline and Borrower Management 
• Manage retail borrower pipelines and monitor milestone progress in real time. 
• Access borrower applications, credit reports, and uploaded documents directly within 
the app. 
• Review and approve documents submitted by borrowers or Third-Party Originators 
(TPOs). 
Credit and Pre-Approval Processing 
• Pull credit reports directly from the loan application. 
• Process new pre-approvals, modify existing ones, and issue updated versions as 
needed. 
• Email or share pre-approval letters securely with borrowers and referral partners. 
Loan Pricing and Guideline Access 
• Integrate with Optimal Blue for real-time loan pricing, product eligibility, and guideline 
retrieval. 
• Price out loans, lock and extend rates, and manage change-of-circumstance requests 
within the same workflow. 
Disclosure and Document Management 
• Send, retrieve, and review loan disclosures and supporting documents from within the 
app. 
• Track borrower acknowledgment and submission status. 
• Push files through processing milestones, request conditions, and monitor status 
through final settlement. 
Mobile and Offline Optimization 
• Ensure reliable performance when operating in low-connectivity environments (e.g., 
while traveling). 
• Enable asynchronous updates and caching so Loan Officers can continue working even 
without strong Wi-Fi. 
• Provide a responsive, simplified interface optimized for mobile devices. 
User Pain Point (Current State) 
Loan Officers, such as Andrew, often face frustration when working remotely due to slow 
connectivity impacting Encompass, CRM, and email systems. The goal is to eliminate 
these bottlenecks by delivering the full loan origination process — from Point of Sale (POS) 
to settlement — in one unified mobile app. 
End-to-End Workflow (Target State) 
• Complete or assist with borrower Point of Sale (POS) applications. 
• Retrieve borrower and property information. 
• Issue, email, and modify pre-approvals. 
• Disclose and submit loan files. 
• Request and review conditions as the file moves through processing. 
• Track milestones and monitor progress through closing. 
• Price, lock, and extend loans directly through Optimal Blue. 
AI-Enhanced Features 
Conversational AI Assistant 
Loan Officers can ask natural-language questions such as: 
“What’s my mortgage payment for $300K with 20% down?” 
“What’s the minimum FICO for FHA?” 
The AI should respond instantly with the correct calculation or guideline reference. 
Voice input ('speak to the app') should be supported. 
Scenario Simulation & Guideline Lookup 
• Retrieve guideline information, pricing scenarios, or investor overlays on demand. 
• AI should recommend possible product matches or eligibility adjustments. 
Embedded Mortgage Tools 
Mortgage calculator, program comparison tool, and voice-driven scenario assistant. 
Future Vision: Multimedia AI (Optional Roadmap) 
Integration with emerging AI technologies (e.g., Sora-like video generation) to produce 
dynamic content for borrower education, marketing, or training — activated through simple 
voice prompts. 
Vision Summary 
The FAHM Mobile App will serve as a single, intelligent workspace for Retail Loan Officers 
— enabling them to originate, price, disclose, and close loans efficiently, from anywhere, 
with AI assistance and seamless system integration.
