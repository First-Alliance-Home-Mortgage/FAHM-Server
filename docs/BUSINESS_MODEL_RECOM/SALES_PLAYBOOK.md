| **Co-branding launch** | Enable realtor/builder referral partner branding ($99/partner/month) |
| **TPO channel** | Target wholesale lenders — brokers get free/cheap access, lender pays platform fee |
| **Inside sales team** | Hire 2-3 AEs, 1 SDR for outbound prospecting |
| **Marketing** | SEO for "mortgage mobile app platform", Google Ads for "Encompass integration", webinars |

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary ICP — Mid-Size Mortgage Lender

| Attribute | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Company size | 10-100 loan officers |
| Annual loan volume | $200M-2B |
| LOS system | Encompass (ICE Mortgage Technology) |
| Current tech stack gap | No custom mobile app or poor borrower portal |
| Geography | United States |
| Decision maker | VP of Technology, CTO, or Owner/CEO |
| Budget authority | $15K-50K annual software spend |
| Pain point | Borrower communication gaps, manual processes, no real-time updates |

### Secondary ICP — Mortgage Brokerage

| Attribute | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Company size | 3-20 loan officers |
| Annual loan volume | $50M-500M |
| LOS system | Any (Encompass preferred) |
| Current tech stack gap | Using generic tools (email, spreadsheets) for borrower communication |
| Pain point | Wants to compete with larger lenders on technology/borrower experience |

### Disqualified Leads

| Signal | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| No Encompass or plans to adopt | Professional tier value prop weakens without LOS integration |
| Fewer than 3 loan officers | Too small for meaningful revenue; offer Starter only |
| Already built custom mobile app | Unlikely to switch; focus on competitive displacement only if dissatisfied |
| Non-US lender | Platform is US mortgage-specific (FCRA, Encompass, Optimal Blue) |

## Discovery Questions

Use these during Stage 2 discovery calls:

### Current State
1. "Walk me through what happens from the moment a borrower applies to when the loan funds. What tools are involved?"
2. "How do your borrowers currently check loan status or upload documents?"
3. "What LOS are you using? How satisfied are you with it?"
4. "Do you have a mobile app today? If so, what does it do?"

### Pain Points
5. "How many status-update calls do your LOs handle per day?"
6. "What's your biggest bottleneck in the loan process right now?"
7. "How do you currently communicate with borrowers? Email? Phone? Text?"
8. "What happens when a milestone is reached — how does the borrower find out?"

### Technology & Integration
9. "What other systems do you use? (CRM, POS, credit bureau, rate engine)"
10. "If you could change one thing about your current technology stack, what would it be?"
11. "How important is it that changes to your mobile app happen without app store updates?"

### Business Impact
12. "How many loans do you close per month? What's your target?"
13. "Have you ever lost a deal because a borrower went to a competitor with better technology?"
14. "How do your referral partners (realtors, builders) interact with your process today?"

### Decision Process
15. "Who else would be involved in evaluating a platform like this?"
16. "What's your timeline for making a technology change?"
17. "Do you have budget allocated for technology improvements this year?"

## Objection Handling

### Price Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "It's too expensive" | "Let's do the math. If each LO handles 10 fewer status-update calls per week at 5 minutes each, that's 4+ hours/week saved per LO. At a loaded cost of $50/hr, that's $800/month per LO in recovered time — our Starter plan pays for itself with just one LO's time savings." |
| "We can build this ourselves" | "You absolutely could. But consider: building a platform like this from scratch typically costs $200K-500K and takes 12-18 months. That's before ongoing maintenance, security updates, and compliance. FAHM gives you all of that for under $18K/year." |
| "Competitor X is cheaper" | "Which competitor? Let me understand what they offer. In most cases, competitors cover only one piece — POS, or borrower portal, or rate engine. FAHM covers the entire lifecycle from application to funding, with real-time mobile management that no one else offers." |

### Technical Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is this secure?" | "Security is foundational. We use JWT authentication with refresh token rotation, helmet security headers, CORS protection, SSRF validation, Twilio webhook signature verification, role-based access control with 16 granular capabilities, and full audit logging. We're pursuing SOC 2 Type II certification." |
| "What about FCRA compliance?" | "We have automated FCRA data retention policies built in. Credit pull consent is tracked per borrower with full audit trail. Reports are stored securely in Azure Blob with configurable retention periods." |
| "How reliable is the Encompass sync?" | "The sync runs every 15 minutes automatically. Every sync is logged in our EncompassSyncLog collection with full error tracking. If a sync fails, it retries on the next cycle without data loss. We also support manual sync triggers." |
| "What if your service goes down?" | "We implement heartbeat monitoring on all WebSocket connections (30-second ping/pong), graceful shutdown handling, and automatic reconnection support. Enterprise customers get a 99.9% uptime SLA with financial remedies." |

### Adoption Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "My LOs won't use another tool" | "That's a fair concern. Two things: First, FAHM reduces their work — fewer status calls, automated milestone notifications, borrower self-service for documents. Second, the dynamic CMS means you can customize exactly what they see, removing complexity. Most LOs adopt within the first week because it immediately saves them time." |
| "My borrowers aren't tech-savvy" | "The mobile experience is designed to be simpler than checking a bank balance. The AI chatbot handles questions in plain language. Push notifications mean borrowers don't even need to open the app to stay informed. In our pilots, even borrowers over 60 adopted successfully." |
| "We just went through a technology change" | "Understood — change fatigue is real. The good news is FAHM integrates alongside your existing tools (Encompass stays your system of record). You can start small with just the borrower portal and expand when ready. No rip-and-replace required." |
